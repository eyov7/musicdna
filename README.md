# MusicDNA: Advanced Audio Sample Detection System

## Project Vision
MusicDNA is an AI-powered system designed to precisely locate and analyze audio samples within full songs using granular multi-level analysis. The system breaks down audio into its fundamental components and analyzes them at multiple levels to provide comprehensive sample detection.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Analysis Levels
- **Spectral Analysis**: Full spectrum examination of audio content
- **Stem Analysis**: Individual analysis of separated audio components (drums, bass, vocals, other)
- **MIDI Analysis**: Musical pattern detection through MIDI conversion
- **Harmonic Analysis**: Key and chord progression detection
- **Rhythmic Analysis**: Beat and rhythm pattern recognition

### 2. Core Components

#### Feature Extraction Pipeline
- Mel-spectrogram computation
- Chroma feature extraction
- MFCC analysis
- Stem separation using Demucs
- MIDI conversion using Basic Pitch
- Musical feature detection (key, tempo, rhythm)

#### Pattern Matching Engine
- Multi-level similarity detection
- Cross-feature validation
- Transformation-aware matching
- Confidence scoring per feature type

#### Transformation Detection
- Pitch shift identification
- Time stretching recognition
- Audio effect detection
- Cross-stem pattern analysis
